Application Concept

Overview 
  In this app, I will implement functionality toward a UI system for a Team Management game. The code behind the scenes will be used to demonstrate good understanding of the four OOP pillars: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.


Team Manager UI 
  Within the UI system the four OOP pillars will be displayed as such:

  Inheritance
    The base object used in the UI will be a Team
    Team -> Soccer Team / Baseball Team / Software Dev Team 

  Polymorphism
    Based on the different types of objects that can be used there will be some base behaviors and some that are specific to the type of team created

    The following are examples of functionality that are required regardless of the team type but may be implemented differently
      - Manage()
      - AddMember()
      - RemoveMember()
      - Train() 

  Encapsulation
    There will be many different aspects of this shown in the system, some examples are shown below:
      - Teams will be required to add new members but will have a size limit on how many members can be added
      - Teams will be able to assign a 'Team Lead' and restrictions will be placed on members that aren't in the lead position

  Abstraction
    This will be showcased via some of the high level functions already shown
      - AddMember()
      - RemoveMember()
